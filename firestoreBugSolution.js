The problem stemmed from an asynchronous operation that wasn't being handled properly. Although the `set()` promise resolved, the data wasn't immediately reflected. The solution involved properly awaiting the promise and optionally adding error handling.

```javascript
// Incorrect code (bug)
const writeData = async () => {
  await db.collection('myCollection').doc('myDocument').set({data: 'value'});
  console.log('Data written (Incorrect)');
};

// Correct Code (solution)
const writeDataCorrect = async () => {
  try {
    await db.collection('myCollection').doc('myDocument').set({data: 'value'});
    console.log('Data written successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error writing data:', error);
  }
};
```
In the 'Incorrect' example, even if the promise is resolved successfully, there's a chance the data is not saved instantly. Using async/await ensures the code waits for the data to be written. The improved version adds a `try...catch` block for robust error handling.
